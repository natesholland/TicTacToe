TicTacToe
=========

A friend once told me that a good way to learn a new language was to write Tic Tac Toe. It uses a little bit of logic, a little bit of IO, and forces you to learn a lot of the basic methods. So here is where I will be putting all of my learning experiences with different languages. Since a lot of these will be the first time I will be using the language I highly doubt they will be particularly elegant or simple. I'll try to put some explenation about what I was thinking in the README's
