Java Implementation of TicTacToe
=========

This was the first TicTacToe I built so it is a little bit sloppy. I've since changed how I implement the board. Also I wanted to go ahead and skeleton the entire project before I wrote any code so I went a little overboard with defining and separating out unnecessary classes and accessing methods. However this was more intended as an acedemic exercise for myself and isn't the most effecient or robust I could make this.
