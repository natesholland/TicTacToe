Ruby Implementation of TicTacToe
=========

This is my implemantation of TicTacToe in Ruby. This was the first time I've ever written anything in Ruby and I did this in an evening. As such I'm sure that I didn't follow some of the conventions in Ruby such as ? and ! for different methods. I may come back and change these later. Feel free to suggest changes or let me know where I didn't follow convention or where things could be improved.
