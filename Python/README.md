Python Implementation for TicTacToe
=========
This is my implementation of TicTacToe in Python. I intentionally made this version as short as possible. I realize a lot of these lines really should be broken out into longer lines to that it is much more readable, but I wanted to write it in less lines than my roommate did.


I went back and made a readable version which also has all the comments in it as well.
