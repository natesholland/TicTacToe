Python Implementation for TicTacToe
=========
This is my implementation of TicTacToe in Python. I intentionally made this version as short as possible. I realize a lot of these lines really should be broken out into longer lines to that it is much more readable, but I wanted to write it in less lines than my roommate did. Maybe I'll go back abd break it into longer lines so it is easier to read.
